Record a movie
> To record a FLC movie, press Shift+M during the game.
> A text "REC" will appear to inform you that recording
> is on (the text will not be visible in recorded movie).
> Note that only video is recorded, no sound. The movie
> will be placed in 'SCRSHOTS' folder; you may play it
> with "mplayer" or its clones. Note that the generated
> file may be large.

Make a screenshot
> Use the Shift+C keys to make screenshot. The image may
> be written in 'mhwanh' HSI/RAW format, or Windows BMP
> format. Format is chosen in KEEPERFX.CFG, 'SCREENSHOT='
> option, which may be set to 'HSI' or 'BMP'.

Make and replay packet file
> These functions can be only enabled by command line
> parameters. You can make a packet file which contains
> the replay with '-packetsave' command, and then play it
> with '-packetload'. When in the replay, you may always
> take over control by pressing Alt+T, or exit with Alt+X.

Release speed mode
> This mode is also available in original DK, but here it's
> a bit enhanced. Normally, the engine limits amount of
> game turns per second. This function allows to stop
> controlling speed - the game will work at its maximum speed,
> which highly depends on your computer hardware.
> To enter released speed mode, press Ctrl+'+' from numpad
> section of your keyboard. Pressing it more than once will
> increase frameskip - some of the frames will not be drawn,
> which will result in even greater increase in speed.
> To cancel the effect, press Ctrl+'-' as many times as you
> pressed Ctrl+'+' before.
