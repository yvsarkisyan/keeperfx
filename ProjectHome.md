An effort to rewrite a game originally published by Bullfrog Productions in 1997.

Unique binary hacks allows it to use original DKs binary code until its completely remade.
As long as the original code is used, the game will only work on Windows platform.

The code is compilable with "make all", and requires only MinGW/Cygwin - no additional libraries are needed.
